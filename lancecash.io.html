3. Pick up tasks on Amazon's Mechanical Turk
Even in the age of automation, some jobs still require a human touch. Companies often outsource those jobs via services like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. As a “worker,” the tasks you’ll be assigned can be tedious — tagging images, transcribing videos, classifying receipts — and can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Temporary employers or “requesters” set the price for each task and get to approve the finished product before paying you. That can leave room for scams, so do your research. Join a community like the MTurk Crowd forum, or the MTurk and Turker Nation subreddits, which can steer you away from shifty dealers. These communities and fellow “workers” can answer questions and give a realistic idea of how much money you can expect to make. Read more about Mechanical Turk as a way to make quick money online.

Total time: Several days to find out if you're approved.
Setup: Depends on the task you choose.
How easy to start: Easy if you have certain skills.
Age threshold: 18+.
How fast you'll get paid: You get paid following work approval, which can take up to 30 days.

You can make money from home by taking online surveys, but don’t expect to be rolling in the dough.

Read our analysis of survey sites to find out which one is best suited for you.

Total time: It will take a while.
Setup: Just minutes.
How easy to start: Very. Just register and begin.
Age threshold: 13 to 18+.
How fast you'll get paid: Varies by site.

Read more about affiliate marketing and other ways bloggers can make money.

Total time: It can take quite a while to build an audience.
Setup: With blog templates, building a site is easy.
How easy to start: Starting is not that difficult. Creating regular content may be another matter.
Age threshold: Any.
How fast you'll get paid: A month or two, on average.

Turn your cat videos into cash videos. If your YouTube videos or blog posts draw a big audience, you may be able to make money from advertising.

YouTube Partners then get access to Google AdSense, a service businesses pay through to advertise around your content. The service is free, but there are requirements you must meet. Read more about how to make money on YouTube and Google AdSense.

Total time: It can take several weeks to get up and running.
Setup: Not that hard.
